# atlas-chain-index-lab

`atlas-chain-index-lab` is a C project for Blockchain tooling. It turns implement a C blockchain tooling project for index format conversion, using round-trip fixtures and lossless normalization checks into a small local model with readable fixtures and a direct verification command.

## Reading Atlas Chain Index Lab

Start with the README, then open `metadata/project.json` to check the constants behind the examples. After that, `fixtures/cases.csv` shows the compact path and `examples/extended_cases.csv` gives a wider look at the same rule.

## Design Sketch

The core is a scoring model over demand, capacity, latency, risk, and weight. That keeps contract state, event replay, and invariant checks in one explicit decision path. The threshold is 150, with risk penalty 5, latency penalty 2, and weight bonus 6. The C implementation keeps headers, source, and assertions separate so bounds and types are easy to review.

## Purpose

I use this kind of project to make a rule visible before adding more machinery around it. The important part here is not the size of the codebase. It is that the input signals, scoring rule, fixture data, and expected output can all be checked in one sitting.

## What It Does

- Uses fixture data to keep event replay changes visible in code review.
- Includes extended examples for invariant checks, including `surge` and `degraded`.
- Documents settlement rules tradeoffs in `docs/operations.md`.
- Runs locally with a single verification command and no external credentials.
- Stores project constants and verification metadata in `metadata/project.json`.

## Fixture Notes

`examples/extended_cases.csv` adds six named cases. I kept the names plain so failures are easy to read in a terminal: baseline, pressure, surge, degraded, recovery, and boundary.

## Files Worth Reading

- `src`: primary implementation
- `tests`: verification harness
- `fixtures`: compact golden scenarios
- `examples`: expanded scenario set
- `metadata`: project constants and verification metadata
- `docs`: operations and extension notes
- `scripts`: local verification and audit commands

## Setup

The only required setup is the local C toolchain. After cloning, stay in the repo root so fixture paths resolve correctly.

## Usage

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/verify.ps1
```

This runs the language-level build or test path against the compact fixture set.

## Verification

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/audit.ps1
```

The audit command checks repository structure and README constraints before it delegates to the verifier.

## Limits

The scoring model is simple by design. More domain-specific behavior should be added through explicit adapters or extra fixture classes rather than hidden constants.

## Next Directions

- Split the scoring constants into a typed configuration object and validate it before use.
- Add a comparison mode that shows how decisions change when one signal is adjusted.
- Add a loader for `examples/extended_cases.csv` and promote selected cases into the language test suite.
- Add one more blockchain tooling fixture that focuses on a malformed or borderline input.
